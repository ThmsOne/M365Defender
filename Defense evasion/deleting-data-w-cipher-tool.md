# Detect cipher.exe deleting data

This query was originally published in the threat analytics report, *Ransomware continues to hit healthcare, critical services*. There is also a related [blog](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2020/04/28/ransomware-groups-continue-to-target-healthcare-critical-services-heres-how-to-reduce-risk/).

In April of 2020, security researchers observed multiple ransomware campaigns using the same set of techniques.

The following query detects the use of the tool *cipher.exe* to delete indicators of malicious activity right before encrypting a drive.

The [See also](#see=also) section below lists more queries related to techniques shared by these campaigns.

## Query

```Kusto
â€‹DeviceProcessEvents 
| where Timestamp > ago(7d)  
| where FileName =~ "cipher.exe"  
// Looking for /w flag for deleting  
| where ProcessCommandLine has "/w"  
| summarize CommandCount = dcount(ProcessCommandLine), 
make_set(ProcessCommandLine) by DeviceId, bin(Timestamp, 1m)  
// Looking for multiple drives in a short timeframe  
| where CommandCount > 1
```
