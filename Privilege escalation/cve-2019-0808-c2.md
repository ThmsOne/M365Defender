This query was originally published in the threat analytics report, *Windows 7 zero-day for CVE-2019-0808*

[CVE-2019-0808](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-0808) is a vulnerability that allows an attacker to escape the Windows security sandbox and run arbitrary code with admin privileges. This vulnerability affects Windows 7, Windows Server 2008, and Windows Server 2008 R2.

Exploits for CVE-2019-0808 were first observed as part of highly selective attacks using the *[Nufsys](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/wdsi/threats/malware-encyclopedia-description?Name=Behavior:Win32/Nufsys.A&threatId=-2147233438)* backdoor. Although the Nufsys-associated exploit was first described as a zero-day, the issue has since been [patched](https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2019-0808).

The following query detects possible CVE-2019-0808 exploitation by reporting network communication associated with the Nufsys attacks.
