# ServicePrincipalAddedToRole [Nobelium]

One of the indicators of compromise for the Nobelium (formerly Solorigate) campaign was that unexpected service principals have been added to privileged roles. This query looks for service principals that have been added to any role.

See [*Understanding "Solorigate"'s Identity IOCs - for Identity Vendors and their customers.*](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-active-directory-identity/understanding-quot-solorigate-quot-s-identity-iocs-for-identity/ba-p/2007610).

## Query

```kusto
let queryTime = 1d;
CloudAppEvents
| where Timestamp > ago(queryTime)
| where Application == "Office 365"
| where ActionType == "Add member to role."
| extend EntityType = RawEventData.Target[2].ID, RoleName = RawEventData.ModifiedProperties[1].NewValue, RoleId = RawEventData.ModifiedProperties[2].NewValue
| where EntityType == "ServicePrincipal"
| project Timestamp , ActionType, ServicePrincipalName = RawEventData.Target[3].ID, ServicePrincipalId = RawEventData.Target[1].ID, RoleName, RoleId, ActorId = AccountObjectId , ActorDisplayName = AccountDisplayName 
```
