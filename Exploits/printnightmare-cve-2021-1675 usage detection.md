# printnightmare-cve-2021-1675 usage detection
 
 First query digs in print spooler drivers folder for any file creations, 
 MANY OF THE FILES THAT SHOULD COME UP HERE MAY BE LEGIT. Unsigned files
 or ones that don't have any relations to printers that you are using are 
 suspicious. 
 
 Second query that can be used for finding client machines that 
 could be operating print servers or file servers is also included here.
 As additional mitigation for the exploit you might want to block the 
 incoming traffic to the SMB or EPMAP Ports (445) if you need to keep the
 spooler service running to print from clients.

## Query
```
DeviceFileEvents
| where Timestamp > ago(7d)
| where ActionType == "FileCreated"
| where FolderPath startswith "C:\\WINDOWS\\SYSTEM32\\SPOOL\\drivers"

DeviceNetworkEvents
| where Timestamp > ago(7d)
| where LocalPort == 445
| summarize RemoteIPCount=dcount(RemoteIP) by DeviceName, InitiatingProcessFileName, InitiatingProcessId, InitiatingProcessCreationTime
```
