# Detect .jse file creation events

This query was originally published in the threat analytics report, *Emulation-evading JavaScripts*.

Attackers in several ransomware campaigns have employed heavily obfuscated JavaScript code, in order to implant malware or execute malicious commands. The obfuscation is intended to help the code evade security systems and potentially escape sandbox environments.

The following query detects the creation of files with a *.jse* extension. Certain ransomware campaigns, such as [Emotet](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2017/11/06/mitigating-and-eliminating-info-stealing-qakbot-and-emotet-in-corporate-networks/), are known to employ encrypted JavaScript code that is saved to the target as *.jse* files.

See [Detect potentially malicious .jse launch by File Explorer or Word](../Execution/jse-launched-by-word.md) for a similar technique.

## Query
