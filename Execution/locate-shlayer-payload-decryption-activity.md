# Locate Shlayer payload decryption activity

This query was originally published in the threat analytics report, *OSX/Shlayer sustains adware push*.

[Shlayer](https://www.intego.com/mac-security-blog/osxshlayer-new-mac-malware-comes-out-of-its-shell/) is adware that spies on users' search terms, and redirects network traffic to serve the user attacker-controlled search results containing ads.

The following query locates activity associated with the Shlayer payload decrypter.

## Query

```Kusto
// Find use of the Shlayer OpenSSL command to decode and decrypt a payload
DeviceProcessEvents
| where Timestamp > ago(7d)
| where FileName =~ "openssl"
and ProcessCommandLine has "-base64" and
ProcessCommandLine has "-out"  and
ProcessCommandLine has "-nosalt"
and ProcessCommandLine has_any("-aes256", "-aes-256")
```
