# Check for ShadowHammer-related implant or container activity

This query was originally published in the threat analytics report, *ShadowHammer supply chain attack*

[Operation ShadowHammer](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/pan9wn/hackers-hijacked-asus-software-updates-to-install-backdoors-on-thousands-of-computers) was an attack against ASUS computer hardware, using the company's own update infrastructure to deliver malware to the company's products. The campaign ran from June to November, 2018. ASUS has since [responded](https://www.asus.com/News/hqfgVUyZ6uyAyJe1) with updates that protect their Live Update system, and diagnostic tools to check affected systems.

The following query checks for activity associated with the ShadowHammer implant or container over the past 30 days.
